This repository is an example of using GitHub Pages.

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub Enterprise Server, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.

There are three types of GitHub Pages sites: project, user, and organization. Project sites are connected to a specific project hosted on GitHub Enterprise Server, such as a JavaScript library or a recipe collection. User and organization sites are connected to a specific account on your GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
